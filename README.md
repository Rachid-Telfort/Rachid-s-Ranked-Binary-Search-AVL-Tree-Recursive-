# Rachid-s-Ranked-Binary-Search-AVL-Tree-Recursive-
About:
	This project was one of three main projects that was assigned to me in my data structures class while I was attending Georgetown University. This project consisted of implementing a binary search AVL tree. The catch was that functions such as insertion, search, and deletion would be based on rank. This, in turn meant that the tree was essentially an order-statistic-tree. I decided to revisit this project to better learn recursion and gain more insight into the tree data structure. When I revisited this project, I decided to add extra features that would potentially be useful in determining certain properties of the binary search tree. This project took me about one month to finish due to testing and debugging. The projectâ€™s original creator is Bala Kayalansundaram, a professor in the Computer Science Department of Georgetown University.
  
Execution File Use:
	The execution file is menu driven. When one first opens it up they will be greeted by several prompts that welcomes them to the project. After the welcoming prompts, a menu prompt will appear showing the user the ways one could manipulate the ranked binary search AVL tree (This menu will reappear after every menu choice is processed). For choosing a menu choice to be processed, one first enters the number associated with the menu choice description and presses enter. This will cause the menu choice to be processed which may cause additional prompts to appear guiding you through the processing of the choice (In fact all prompts and menu choices can be processed in a similar way). I understand that these are very basic instructions on how to use the execution file. If one would like more clarification or has suggestions, please comment on the project page on GitHub or email me at rachidtelfort@gmail.com.
  
Source Code Use:
	The source code associated with this project is free for anyone to use. If one has found any bugs or has any suggestions/questions relating to the source code, please comment on the project page or email me at rachidtelfort@gmail.com.
  
Final Notes:
	This version of the project is a recursive version which means that all the necessary functions were implemented to be used recursively. When I have the time, I will implement a non-recursive version of this project.
	I hope that my fellow coders will find the source code helpful as well as gain valuable insight from it. If you have read this, thank you for looking at my GitHub page it is much appreciated.
